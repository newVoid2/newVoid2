# Hi, I'm Richard 👋

I'm a software developer based in Easton, Pennsylvania. Most of my experience so far has been building web applications end to end — from the UI to the backend and database, and getting everything deployed and running.

These days I'm steadily tightening up my fundamentals, with more focus on Python, backend work, and using code to move and work with data. I like projects that are practical and that I can iterate on over time.

- 💻 I enjoy building small tools, APIs, and experiment apps.
- 🤝 I'm open to collaborating on focused, realistic projects.

## What you'll find here

- Full-stack apps from my earlier web dev work (like **Smart Brain**)
- Experiments with LLMs and question-answering over documents
- Smaller practice repos and archived learning projects

Over time I’m aiming to keep a few solid, well-documented projects here instead of a huge pile of half-finished ones.
