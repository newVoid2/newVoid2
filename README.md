# Hi, I'm Richard 👋

I’m a Python-focused developer based in Easton, Pennsylvania, currently building scripts and small projects to strengthen my skills in automation, data handling, and practical problem solving. This profile reflects ongoing learning and experimentation.


These days I'm steadily tightening up my fundamentals with more focus on Python, backend development, and using code to work with data. I like projects that are practical, data-driven, and that I can iterate on over time.

Currently focusing on Python, SQL, and backend work to transition into data-focused engineering roles.

* 💻 I enjoy building small tools, APIs, and experimental apps.
* 🤝 I'm open to collaborating on focused, realistic projects.

## Tech I'm comfortable with

* **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, C, C++
* **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, Sass
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Data & Storage:** PostgreSQL
* **Other:** Git, GitHub, Heroku

## What you'll find here

* Python- and data-focused experiments
* LLM and question-answering projects
* Full-stack apps (e.g., **Smart Brain**)
* Practice repos and archived learning projects

Over time I’m aiming to keep a few solid, well-documented projects here rather than a pile of half-finished ones.

I’m open to backend, Python developer, or data-focused engineering opportunities.
